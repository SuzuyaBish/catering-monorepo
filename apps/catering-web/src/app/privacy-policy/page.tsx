        Privacy Policy for The Cooked Sisters
      </div>
      At The Cooked Sisters, we prioritize the privacy of our website visitors
      and customers. This Privacy Policy outlines the information we collect,
      how itâ€™s used, and the choices you have concerning your data.
      <ul className="space-y-5">
        <li>Information Collection and Use</li>
        We may collect personal information such as names, email addresses,
        phone numbers, and addresses when voluntarily provided by users through
        our website&#39;s contact forms or when placing orders. This information
        is solely used to fulfil service requests, respond to inquiries, and
        improve our services.
        <li>Cookies</li>
        Our website may use cookies to enhance user experience. Cookies are
        small files stored on your device that improve website functionality and
        may collect non-personal information about your browsing behaviour.
        Users can choose to disable cookies through their browser settings.
        <li>Third-Party Services</li>
        We may use third-party services, such as analytics tools or payment
        processors, to better understand website usage or facilitate
        transactions. These third parties have their own privacy policies
        governing the use of your information.
        <li>Data Security</li>
        We take reasonable steps to protect user information and ensure it is
        not lost, misused, or accessed without authorization. However, no method
        of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely
        secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        <li>Your Rights</li>
        Users have the right to access, modify, or delete their personal
        information stored by The Cooked Sisters. Please contact us if you wish
        to exercise these rights or have any concerns regarding your data.
